Verilog and FPGA HLS Learning Projects

This repository serves as a personal log and collection of various digital design projects undertaken to learn Verilog HDL and gain familiarity with the Xilinx Vivado HLS (High-Level Synthesis) design flow.

Each subdirectory represents a distinct project, showcasing different Verilog concepts and hardware design principles, building towards more complex FPGA-relevant skills.
